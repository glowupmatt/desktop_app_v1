# Checklist for Creating a pywebview + Flask + React (Vite) Desktop App

## 1. **Project Setup**
- [ ] Create a project directory for your app:
  ```bash
  mkdir pywebview_react_vite_app
  cd pywebview_react_vite_app
  ```
- [ ] Initialize a Python virtual environment:
  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- [ ] Install backend dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install pywebview flask
  ```

## 2. **Backend Development**
- [ ] Create a Python file (`main.py`) for Flask and pywebview integration:
  - [ ] Serve the React app's static files from Flask.
  - [ ] Start a Flask server in a background thread.
  - [ ] Use pywebview to create a desktop window that loads the React app.

## 3. **Frontend Setup (React + Vite)**
- [ ] Initialize a React project using Vite:
  ```bash
  npm create vite@latest frontend --template react
  cd frontend
  ```
- [ ] Install required npm dependencies:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

## 4. **Frontend Configuration**
- [ ] Update the `vite.config.js` file to build the React app in a path Flask can serve:
  ```javascript
  import { defineConfig } from "vite";
  import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";

  export default defineConfig({
      plugins: [react()],
      build: {
          outDir: "../frontend/dist", // Place the build folder where Flask can serve it
          emptyOutDir: true,          // Clear the folder before building
      },
  });
  ```

## 5. **Connect Frontend and Backend**
- [ ] Build the React app for production:
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```
- [ ] Verify that Flask serves the React app correctly by running:
  ```bash
  python main.py
  ```

## 6. **Testing**
- [ ] Test the app by running `main.py` to ensure:
  - [ ] Flask serves the React app correctly.
  - [ ] The pywebview window loads the React app.

## 7. **Optional Enhancements**
- [ ] Add Flask API routes for backend functionality.
- [ ] Use `fetch` or `axios` in React to communicate with Flask APIs.
- [ ] Style the app using CSS frameworks (e.g., TailwindCSS, Material-UI).
- [ ] Add error handling and logging in both Flask and React.

## 8. **Run the Final Application**
- [ ] Start the app by running:
  ```bash
  python main.py
  ```
- [ ] Validate that the React-based UI is displayed in the pywebview window.

### Notes:
- Keep the `dist/` folder up to date by rebuilding the React app whenever you make changes to the frontend.
- Use environment variables to manage configurations (e.g., debug mode, Flask port).
- For larger projects, consider organizing the Flask backend into a modular structure.
